No programming is required for this puzzle, so this is just a text file.

Step 1: Light ray
- The puzzle name suggests that the small dashes are mirrors
- Notice that all mirror angles are such that light rays move at an
  angle which is a multiple of 45 degrees.
- There is a "special" light ray which starts and ends at the two mirrors
  which are misaligned from the center of their cell.
- Draw this light ray on the grid.

Step 2: Message
- The whole grid can be though of as a 4x4 grid of squares.
- Inside each square, there are two lines drawn by the light ray.
- The yellow/red coloring suggests the flag semaphore system.
- Translating each square into a letter using this system, we get the message:
SEASON'S GREETINGS
